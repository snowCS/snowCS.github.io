<h1>Cat</h1>
<p>The <b>cat</b> (<i>Felis catus</i>) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is often referred to as the <b>domestic cat</b> to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.</p>
<p>Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species: they have a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular). Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. Compared to humans, they see better in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell, but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.</p>
<p>Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.</p>
<p>Since cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 13,000 years ago (11,000 BC). A 2017 study found that domestic cats were present in Europe from around 4400 BC during the Neolithic period.</p>
<p>As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, after freshwater fish,<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> with 95 million cats owned.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> In the United Kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>
